In Kubernetes, a ResourceQuota is used to limit the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources that can be consumed by a namespace.

A resource quota can be used to prevent a namespace from using too many resources, which can cause performance issues or impact the reliability of other applications running in the same cluster. By setting limits on the amount of resources that can be used in a namespace, you can ensure that each application has access to the resources it needs to run reliably, without impacting other applications.

Resource quotas can be used to enforce resource usage policies across different teams or applications running in the same cluster. For example, you may want to limit the amount of CPU and memory that a development team can use in order to ensure that there are enough resources available for production workloads.

Resource quotas can also be used to prevent accidental resource exhaustion caused by misconfigured or runaway applications. By setting limits on the amount of resources that can be used in a namespace, you can prevent a single application from monopolizing all of the resources in the cluster.

Overall, resource quotas are an important tool for managing resource usage in Kubernetes clusters and ensuring that each application has access to the resources it needs to run reliably.

In Kubernetes, a ResourceQuota is used to limit the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources that can be consumed by a namespace.

Here's an example YAML file that demonstrates how to create a ResourceQuota:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-quota
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 2Gi
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: 4Gi
In this example, we're creating a ResourceQuota named my-quota. We're using the spec field to specify the hard limits on the number of pods, CPU, and memory that can be used in the namespace.

The pods field specifies the maximum number of pods that can be created in the namespace. The requests.cpu and requests.memory fields specify the maximum amount of CPU and memory that can be requested by all pods in the namespace. The limits.cpu and limits.memory fields specify the maximum amount of CPU and memory that can be used by all pods in the namespace.

You can apply this YAML file using the kubectl apply command. For example:

kubectl apply -f my-quota.yaml
Once applied, this ResourceQuota will limit the amount of resources that can be consumed by all pods in the namespace. If a pod tries to exceed these limits, Kubernetes will prevent it from being created or will evict it if it is already running.

Example2:

A Resource Quota, in Kubernetes, is a tool for administrators to limit the resource consumption per Namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.

Resource quotas work in two ways:

Compute Resource Quota: This restricts the total amount of compute resources that can be requested in a given namespace. The compute resources could be CPU, memory, storage, or even ephemeral storage. For example, you can limit the total amount of memory that all Pods in a namespace can have.

Object Count Quota: This restricts the total number of a particular type of object that can exist in a namespace. Objects could be Pods, ConfigMaps, PersistentVolumeClaims, Services, Secrets, etc.

Here is an example of a resource quota:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: myquota
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 5Gi
    limits.cpu: "10"
    limits.memory: 10Gi
In this example:

The total number of Pods in the namespace cannot exceed 10.
The total CPU request for all Pods in the namespace cannot exceed 4 cores.
The total memory request for all Pods in the namespace cannot exceed 5 GiB.
The total CPU limit for all Pods in the namespace cannot exceed 10 cores.
The total memory limit for all Pods in the namespace cannot exceed 10 GiB.
Resource quotas can help prevent a single namespace from consuming all the resources in a cluster, and also ensures that each namespace is only using resources within its means. When a resource quota is exceeded, the Kubernetes API server will not accept any new resource creation requests for that namespace.
